# Alias Registration Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Created `backend/controllers/view/aliasRegistration.js`**
   - Utility function `getAliasRegistrationHTML()` that generates SSR alias registration forms
   - Pre-fills and disables the first field if user is logged in
   - Supports different game modes: `local`, `ai`, and `tournament`

2. **Updated `backend/routes/viewRoutes.js`**
   - Modified `/game/local` route to check for `registered` query parameter
   - Shows alias registration form when `registered` is not `true`
   - Detects AI mode via `ai=1` query parameter
   - Modified `/game/local-tournament` route to show alias registration when `players` query parameter is present
   - Added import for `getAliasRegistrationHTML` utility

### Frontend Changes

1. **Created `frontend/ts/aliasRegistration.ts`**
   - Handles form submissions for local, AI, and tournament alias registration
   - Validates aliases using existing `checkNickname()` function
   - Stores aliases in `sessionStorage` for local/AI games
   - Creates tournament via API for tournament mode
   - Navigates to appropriate game URLs after registration

2. **Updated `frontend/ts/app.ts`**
   - Imported `initAliasRegistration` function
   - Modified `runChosenGame()` to properly handle URL parameters
   - Checks for `registered` parameter to determine whether to show game or registration form
   - Added cleanup of `localGameAliases` from sessionStorage when leaving game flow

3. **Updated `frontend/ts/localGame.ts`**
   - Added `setupLocalGameAliases()` function to load player names from sessionStorage
   - Modified `setupTournamentBridgeIfNeeded()` to call `setupLocalGameAliases()` when not in tournament mode
   - Ensures tournament games and regular local games both have proper player name display

4. **Updated `frontend/ts/tournament.ts`**
   - Modified `showRegistration()` to navigate to backend SSR form instead of generating form on frontend
   - Modified `goToLocalGameForMatch()` to add `registered=true` parameter when navigating to local game
   - Added check for `newTournament` in sessionStorage to render initial bracket after registration
   - Tournament now uses consistent SSR forms like other game modes

## How It Works

### Local 1v1 Game Flow
1. User navigates to `/game/local`
2. Backend shows alias registration form (2 players)
3. User fills in aliases and submits
4. Frontend stores aliases in `sessionStorage` and navigates to `/game/local?registered=true`
5. Game loads with player names displayed from sessionStorage

### Local AI Game Flow
1. User navigates to `/game/local?ai=1`
2. Backend shows alias registration form (1 player)
3. User fills in alias and submits
4. Frontend stores alias in `sessionStorage` and navigates to `/game/local?ai=1&registered=true`
5. Game loads with player name displayed

### Tournament Flow
1. User selects 4 or 8 players
2. Frontend navigates to `/game/local-tournament?players=4` (or 8)
3. Backend shows alias registration form with appropriate number of fields
4. User fills in aliases and submits
5. Frontend creates tournament via API
6. Tournament bracket is displayed
7. When match starts, navigate to `/game/local?registered=true` with `tournamentMatch` in sessionStorage
8. Game distinguishes tournament match from regular local game via sessionStorage

## Special Considerations

### Logged-in Users
- First field is pre-filled with user's nickname
- First field is disabled with `class="disabled"` attribute
- Works consistently across all three game modes

### Tournament vs Regular Local Games
- Tournament sets `tournamentMatch` in sessionStorage before navigating to `/game/local`
- Regular local games set `localGameAliases` in sessionStorage
- Both use `registered=true` query parameter to bypass registration form
- Game properly displays names from appropriate sessionStorage key

### Cleanup
- `localGameAliases` is removed when leaving game flow
- Tournament data is managed by existing tournament cleanup code
- Ensures no stale data persists between sessions
